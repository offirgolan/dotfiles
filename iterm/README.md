# iTerm

During the setup process, a custom Chesterish color scheme will be installed into your iTerm. Go to Profiles => Colors => Load Presets to pick Chesterish.

Here are the customizations:

- Theme (not to be confused with zsh theme): Chesterish
- Set up a system wide hotkey for iTerm (Keys => Hotkey): Recommended `Cmd-Escape`
- Uncheck `Use Lion-style full screen` on General. This will give you fast full screen windows that are switchable without switching to spaces

To use the settings file in this directory, go to General -> Load preferences from a custom folder or URL and point it to `~/dotfiles/iterm`. Also tick 'Save changes to folder when iTerm2 quits'.
